          <p>Our field guide is a simple non-technical guide to how we operate at Moltin. It doesn’t contain anything about setting up the API on your local machine, how to parse XML in Lisp or anything on geometric theory. Its about the basic principles we all want to work by, and should be read by all new team members.</p>

<p>As Moltin continues to grow we hope that these principles will serve each new person, and that everyone in the team can help build on them and make us an even better company... Even better than we are now.</p>

<h3>
<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h3>

<p>The field guide is open source, we heavily encourage changes and updates from anyone in the organisation. Fork the main repo and submit your P/R for review.</p>

<p>We would like all new members to contribute something, even if it’s just reading material, but if you don’t feel comfortable, you can just as easily make notes, bring up issues or enhancements in the github repo, we’ll review them and bundle them into a versioned update.</p>


<h2>
<a id="welcome-to-moltin" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-moltin" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Moltin</h2>

<h3>
<a id="what-were-trying-to-do" class="anchor" href="#what-were-trying-to-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we're trying to do</h3>

<p>In a connected world there is no such thing as eCommerce, there is only commerce. If your system can connect to the internet, if your system manages stock, if your system sells things, it should be powered by Moltin. Simple as that.</p>

<p>No one should be in denial about the scope of our project, we’re here to change everything about commerce.
Who do we work for?
We do not work for governments, our investors, or ourselves, we work for our users, they are our most important asset.</p>

<h3>
<a id="organisation" class="anchor" href="#organisation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organisation</h3>

<p>Organisation is often something that happens, rather than something that is planned. At Moltin we’re trying hard to keep a very flat structure. We’ve spent too many years in other companies having more bosses to account to than feet on the ground, and we generally found that in-efficient and frustrating.</p>

<p>One week you may find you’re leading a small team, the next week you may be taking a back seat whilst someone else is calling the shots. As features and projects roll by we expect to find different people taking a driving seat depending on their skills or passion for that unit of work.</p>

<p>Of course some people like to lead more than others and that’s fine, we should all be happy to be fluid in that respect.</p>


<h3>
<a id="ethos" class="anchor" href="#ethos" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ethos</h3>

<p>We don’t like to make many rules, but we have a few simple tenets we try to work by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accept New Ideas. Everyone and anything should be open to new ideas about work processes, structure, best practices, conventions etc… If we’re all open and embrace new things we can’t overlook great ideas when they do come around.</li>
<li>Don’t be a dick. Pretty simple.</li>
<li>Work hard. We’re in an undeniable position. Its going to be hard work, but it will be fun. Accept that, embrace it, hard work has its own rewards, it also brings teams closer, makes achievements sweeter, and makes the times when you can relax all the better. </li>
<li>Work smart. If you’re performing repetitive, time consuming tasks, you might be doing something wrong. Always ask yourself, “Am I working smart?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember stagnation can be a killer, everyone should be open to change. The more fluid we are the quicker we can react to new scenarios, expand, learn and thrive.</p>


<h2>
<a id="workflow" class="anchor" href="#workflow" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow</h2>

<p>We hire smart people, and accept that it’s in their nature to work to a pattern that suits them.</p>

<p>There are however some specifics we like to highlight and some practices we’d like to standardise across the company. We mention them because we think they’re important to how the company operates and how everyone can work together efficiently.</p>

<h3>
<a id="google-docs" class="anchor" href="#google-docs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Google Docs</h3>

<p>Team collaboration is a big part of Moltin. You will find that sometimes you need to write up specifications, findings, sheet data and a myriad of other ideas, concepts, or ramblings.</p>

<p>We ask two things from everyone who does work in this scope.</p>

<p>Be collaborative. Work together on documents when possible. Ask someone to check your wording, check your calculations, check your naming conventions, etc… Group discussions are important to spreading good ideas.
Use Google Docs/sheets/etc. Standardised, easy to collaborate and share between the team, easy to find again, easy to organise, easy to share outside the team, linked to individuals. Always use Google Docs!</p>

<p>Emails
Moltin uses Google Apps for business, which means our email system is essentially Gmail. Most of our external communication is via email, most of our internal communication is via slack. </p>

<p>Some things to keep in mind when using email:</p>

<p>Undo. We advise you use in-browser gmail and enable the “undo” button for your account. You’ll be surprised how helpful a few seconds delay is on an email after you hit send. You can fix many accidental fails this way.
Email Footer. If you haven’t been setup with an email footer, ask someone to help you sort it out before you do anything else.
Attitude. Emails are usually external communications, that means it is often the first time another person or company will interact with us. That means be courteous, helpful, understanding, etc…  don’t be a dick!
Gifs! Have a good rapport with someone? A gif can say a thousand words :)</p>

<p>Slack
Slack comprises the majority of our internal discussions, support, chit-chat, and group learning it gives us the ability to automate process and work effectively, and will continue to be an active asset for the company. 
Our attitudes to Slack:</p>

<p>Use it. Use it as often as possible. Of course in an office it’s easier to talk face to face, but if you have a particularly complex discussion and actually walk away with some conclusions, add them to slack in short form. Those conclusions are not only searchable now and forever, but relevant to others who might have missed the conversation, or may be affected by the decisions.
Channels. Its very important to use the relevant channel, if there isn’t one, make one… 
Be around. We try to have a relaxed work schedule at Moltin, but we ask one thing, try to be around on slack.
Gifs! Gif all the things
Share. Learned something new? Found a great blog post? Have a new idea? Share it. We take the concept that if you’re not sharing new things regularly, then you may be stagnating, or not enjoying yourself. Share liberally, share often.
Groups. There are hundreds of other slack groups and channels out there, join them, share them, be visible and be active. Its healthy to communicate and learn new ideas across a broad spectrum, so not just within the company.
Automate. Think you can automate something into Slack? DO IT! We love that kind of thing.
Moltin Hub. Be in it! Our community is one of the most important things. Be vocal, be visible, be active. </p>

<p>Github
Every repository Moltin owns is hosted on Github. Github offers not just a fantastic standard of version control hosting, but it is another front facing asset of the company, a visible portal of the health and competence of our company. With that in mind, here’s a few things to watch out for:</p>

<p>Be there. Everyone should have a github account.
Be vocal. Be vocal on issues and threads, ask questions, be brave, break boundaries.
Good attitude. Be careful in your chosen words when commenting on threads/issues. As goes with emails, this is a public realm and you and the company can be put in an unhealthy light if you act in a disreputable manner.
Be Active. Be as active as you can on other repos. Its great for yours and our rep.
Know Git and Github. In the technical handbook, we’ll outline this more, but everyone should have a basic understanding of git and github.
Follow Github Flow. <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/</a>
Fork Other Repos. Want to change it for yourself? Want to fix something? Want to create something from something else? Fork it, fork all the things, be smart but be liberal if it will help you and the company.
Personal Repositories. We ask that you make a distinction between work and personal projects. Don’t fork a private Moltin repo to your personal account, don’t fork a personal project to the Moltin account. (Boundaries aren’t always clear, so, If you’re unsure, just ask!)
Open Source. Its not always possible to open source everything we do. But, that doesn’t mean we don’t want to. Always ask yourself, can this be open sourced? If so, build it in a way that makes that possible.</p>

<p>Jira
Jira is the software we use to plan all our issues, bugs, features, sprints etc… Jira can be a beast, but, it’s a rich system, and once you spend some time getting to know it, you’ll find how valuable it can be.</p>

<p>Time/build management is a whole other document in its own right, and something we’ll try and cover in the technical document more, but here are some basic things we try to adhere to:</p>

<p>Be there. Everyone should have a personal account. If you don’t, stop everything and ask for one.
Use it! Even if it’s not a big task. We’re happy for you to take a bit of time planning something out into steps. It means you know what you’re doing if you’re sidetracked, and the team as a whole knows what you're doing and be kept up to date with progress across the board. This also goes for any non-technical roles.
Help each other. As mentioned Jira can be a bit of a monster at first, so help each other. That goes from someone needing help finding the right page or button, to someone using bad naming conventions or not breaking tasks down enough, mention it. We’re all here to learn and make ourselves better.</p>

<p>Working hours
We have a liberal approach to working hours. We do however ask for the first 3-6 months you attain a normal 9 to 5 working pattern. This is so we can get you up to speed with the company and whatever part of it you’ll be working in. Once you’ve settled in, you’ll find your office hours become more malleable.</p>

<p>Every now and then people wish to push themselves a bit further and put in more than the usual hours. While this is great for a deadline, if this is happening regularly it’s a sign that something isn’t working correctly. We spend a lot of time hiring the right people who can strike a good balance between work and life outside.</p>

<p>If you find yourself working too many hours, you should mention it so it can be addressed.</p>

<p>Infrastructure
“The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.”</p>

<p>Infrastructure is the physical aspect of our delivery. Its the servers, databases, load balancers and programs that govern how our software is delivered to the end user. Infrastructure is a constantly changing battlefield. Many factors including security, latency, load and more contribute to decisions made in infrastructure.</p>

<p>As a basic tenet we like everyone to understand the following:</p>

<p>Our infrastructure is worldwide.
Our infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.
Our infrastructure is the base we build on and is super important.</p>

<p>Infrastructure is covered more heavily in the technical handbook.</p>

<p>Help!
Sometimes we all need a bit of help, especially when you’re in a new environment. Help can come in many forms, perhaps you can’t connect to the internet? Perhaps you’ve lost your favourite pen? Or perhaps you feel like you’re struggling with a concept or workload.</p>

<p>A few words of advice in some of the more serious situations you might need help in.</p>

<p>Be calm, relax, think. if you’re working with us, it’s because we like you and we think you can do it! Take a break, have a cup of tea, step outside, talk to someone, have a think logically and figure out your next step.</p>

<p>Don’t bottle it up. Don’t sweep it under the carpet. Be honest. Be open. We’re all here to help each other, if you’re having a tough time with anything talk to someone.
What if I mess up?
We don’t penalise people for making a mistake, it wouldn’t be beneficial for anyone. Most mistakes can be repaired, and it’s important we build an environment where the freedom to fail is enabled.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can make is not learning from the previous one, that’s when we know we have a problem. So always be keen to test your ideas, but don’t ignore evidence or rush for the sake of it. Be careful, take advice and learn from past errors.
