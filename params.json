{"name":"Moltin Field guide","tagline":"A company field guide","body":"\r\nOur field guide is a simple non-technical guide to how we operate at Moltin. It doesn’t contain anything about setting up the API on your local machine, how to parse XML in Lisp or anything on geometric theory. Its about the basic principles we all want to work by, and should be read by all new team members.\r\n\r\nAs Moltin continues to grow we hope that these principles will serve each new person, and that everyone in the team can help build on them and make us an even better company... Even better than we are now.\r\n\r\n###Contributing\r\nThe field guide is open source, we heavily encourage changes and updates from anyone in the organisation. Fork the main repo and submit your P/R for review.\r\n\r\nWe would like all new members to contribute something, even if it’s just reading material, but if you don’t feel comfortable, you can just as easily make notes, bring up issues or enhancements in the github repo, we’ll review them and bundle them into a versioned update.\r\n\r\n\f\r\n##Welcome to Moltin\r\n\r\n###What we're trying to do\r\nIn a connected world there is no such thing as eCommerce, there is only commerce. If your system can connect to the internet, if your system manages stock, if your system sells things, it should be powered by Moltin. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nNo one should be in denial about the scope of our project, we’re here to change everything about commerce.\r\nWho do we work for?\r\nWe do not work for governments, our investors, or ourselves, we work for our users, they are our most important asset.\r\n \r\n###Organisation\r\nOrganisation is often something that happens, rather than something that is planned. At Moltin we’re trying hard to keep a very flat structure. We’ve spent too many years in other companies having more bosses to account to than feet on the ground, and we generally found that in-efficient and frustrating.\r\n\r\nOne week you may find you’re leading a small team, the next week you may be taking a back seat whilst someone else is calling the shots. As features and projects roll by we expect to find different people taking a driving seat depending on their skills or passion for that unit of work.\r\n\r\nOf course some people like to lead more than others and that’s fine, we should all be happy to be fluid in that respect.\r\n\r\n\f\r\n###Ethos\r\nWe don’t like to make many rules, but we have a few simple tenets we try to work by:\r\n\r\n - Accept New Ideas. Everyone and anything should be open to new ideas about work processes, structure, best practices, conventions etc… If we’re all open and embrace new things we can’t overlook great ideas when they do come around.\r\n - Don’t be a dick. Pretty simple.\r\n - Work hard. We’re in an undeniable position. Its going to be hard work, but it will be fun. Accept that, embrace it, hard work has its own rewards, it also brings teams closer, makes achievements sweeter, and makes the times when you can relax all the better. \r\n - Work smart. If you’re performing repetitive, time consuming tasks, you might be doing something wrong. Always ask yourself, “Am I working smart?”\r\n\r\nRemember stagnation can be a killer, everyone should be open to change. The more fluid we are the quicker we can react to new scenarios, expand, learn and thrive.\r\n\r\n\f\r\n##Workflow\r\nWe hire smart people, and accept that it’s in their nature to work to a pattern that suits them.\r\n\r\nThere are however some specifics we like to highlight and some practices we’d like to standardise across the company. We mention them because we think they’re important to how the company operates and how everyone can work together efficiently.\r\n\r\n###Google Docs\r\nTeam collaboration is a big part of Moltin. You will find that sometimes you need to write up specifications, findings, sheet data and a myriad of other ideas, concepts, or ramblings.\r\n\r\nWe ask two things from everyone who does work in this scope.\r\n\r\nBe collaborative. Work together on documents when possible. Ask someone to check your wording, check your calculations, check your naming conventions, etc… Group discussions are important to spreading good ideas.\r\nUse Google Docs/sheets/etc. Standardised, easy to collaborate and share between the team, easy to find again, easy to organise, easy to share outside the team, linked to individuals. Always use Google Docs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nEmails\r\nMoltin uses Google Apps for business, which means our email system is essentially Gmail. Most of our external communication is via email, most of our internal communication is via slack. \r\n\r\nSome things to keep in mind when using email:\r\n\r\nUndo. We advise you use in-browser gmail and enable the “undo” button for your account. You’ll be surprised how helpful a few seconds delay is on an email after you hit send. You can fix many accidental fails this way.\r\nEmail Footer. If you haven’t been setup with an email footer, ask someone to help you sort it out before you do anything else.\r\nAttitude. Emails are usually external communications, that means it is often the first time another person or company will interact with us. That means be courteous, helpful, understanding, etc…  don’t be a dick!\r\nGifs! Have a good rapport with someone? A gif can say a thousand words :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nSlack\r\nSlack comprises the majority of our internal discussions, support, chit-chat, and group learning it gives us the ability to automate process and work effectively, and will continue to be an active asset for the company. \r\nOur attitudes to Slack:\r\n\r\nUse it. Use it as often as possible. Of course in an office it’s easier to talk face to face, but if you have a particularly complex discussion and actually walk away with some conclusions, add them to slack in short form. Those conclusions are not only searchable now and forever, but relevant to others who might have missed the conversation, or may be affected by the decisions.\r\nChannels. Its very important to use the relevant channel, if there isn’t one, make one… \r\nBe around. We try to have a relaxed work schedule at Moltin, but we ask one thing, try to be around on slack.\r\nGifs! Gif all the things\r\nShare. Learned something new? Found a great blog post? Have a new idea? Share it. We take the concept that if you’re not sharing new things regularly, then you may be stagnating, or not enjoying yourself. Share liberally, share often.\r\nGroups. There are hundreds of other slack groups and channels out there, join them, share them, be visible and be active. Its healthy to communicate and learn new ideas across a broad spectrum, so not just within the company.\r\nAutomate. Think you can automate something into Slack? DO IT! We love that kind of thing.\r\nMoltin Hub. Be in it! Our community is one of the most important things. Be vocal, be visible, be active. \r\n \r\nGithub\r\nEvery repository Moltin owns is hosted on Github. Github offers not just a fantastic standard of version control hosting, but it is another front facing asset of the company, a visible portal of the health and competence of our company. With that in mind, here’s a few things to watch out for:\r\n\r\nBe there. Everyone should have a github account.\r\nBe vocal. Be vocal on issues and threads, ask questions, be brave, break boundaries.\r\nGood attitude. Be careful in your chosen words when commenting on threads/issues. As goes with emails, this is a public realm and you and the company can be put in an unhealthy light if you act in a disreputable manner.\r\nBe Active. Be as active as you can on other repos. Its great for yours and our rep.\r\nKnow Git and Github. In the technical handbook, we’ll outline this more, but everyone should have a basic understanding of git and github.\r\nFollow Github Flow. https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/\r\nFork Other Repos. Want to change it for yourself? Want to fix something? Want to create something from something else? Fork it, fork all the things, be smart but be liberal if it will help you and the company.\r\nPersonal Repositories. We ask that you make a distinction between work and personal projects. Don’t fork a private Moltin repo to your personal account, don’t fork a personal project to the Moltin account. (Boundaries aren’t always clear, so, If you’re unsure, just ask!)\r\nOpen Source. Its not always possible to open source everything we do. But, that doesn’t mean we don’t want to. Always ask yourself, can this be open sourced? If so, build it in a way that makes that possible.\r\n\r\nJira\r\nJira is the software we use to plan all our issues, bugs, features, sprints etc… Jira can be a beast, but, it’s a rich system, and once you spend some time getting to know it, you’ll find how valuable it can be.\r\n\r\nTime/build management is a whole other document in its own right, and something we’ll try and cover in the technical document more, but here are some basic things we try to adhere to:\r\n\r\nBe there. Everyone should have a personal account. If you don’t, stop everything and ask for one.\r\nUse it! Even if it’s not a big task. We’re happy for you to take a bit of time planning something out into steps. It means you know what you’re doing if you’re sidetracked, and the team as a whole knows what you're doing and be kept up to date with progress across the board. This also goes for any non-technical roles.\r\nHelp each other. As mentioned Jira can be a bit of a monster at first, so help each other. That goes from someone needing help finding the right page or button, to someone using bad naming conventions or not breaking tasks down enough, mention it. We’re all here to learn and make ourselves better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nWorking hours\r\nWe have a liberal approach to working hours. We do however ask for the first 3-6 months you attain a normal 9 to 5 working pattern. This is so we can get you up to speed with the company and whatever part of it you’ll be working in. Once you’ve settled in, you’ll find your office hours become more malleable.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then people wish to push themselves a bit further and put in more than the usual hours. While this is great for a deadline, if this is happening regularly it’s a sign that something isn’t working correctly. We spend a lot of time hiring the right people who can strike a good balance between work and life outside.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself working too many hours, you should mention it so it can be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nA guide to working in the office\r\nComing soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nInfrastructure\r\n“The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.”\r\n\r\nInfrastructure is the physical aspect of our delivery. Its the servers, databases, load balancers and programs that govern how our software is delivered to the end user. Infrastructure is a constantly changing battlefield. Many factors including security, latency, load and more contribute to decisions made in infrastructure.\r\n\r\nAs a basic tenet we like everyone to understand the following:\r\n\r\nOur infrastructure is worldwide.\r\nOur infrastructure is built on Amazon Web Services.\r\nOur infrastructure is the base we build on and is super important.\r\n\r\nInfrastructure is covered more heavily in the technical handbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nHelp!\r\nSometimes we all need a bit of help, especially when you’re in a new environment. Help can come in many forms, perhaps you can’t connect to the internet? Perhaps you’ve lost your favourite pen? Or perhaps you feel like you’re struggling with a concept or workload.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words of advice in some of the more serious situations you might need help in.\r\n\r\nBe calm, relax, think. if you’re working with us, it’s because we like you and we think you can do it! Take a break, have a cup of tea, step outside, talk to someone, have a think logically and figure out your next step.\r\n\r\nDon’t bottle it up. Don’t sweep it under the carpet. Be honest. Be open. We’re all here to help each other, if you’re having a tough time with anything talk to someone.\r\nWhat if I mess up?\r\nWe don’t penalise people for making a mistake, it wouldn’t be beneficial for anyone. Most mistakes can be repaired, and it’s important we build an environment where the freedom to fail is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe biggest mistake you can make is not learning from the previous one, that’s when we know we have a problem. So always be keen to test your ideas, but don’t ignore evidence or rush for the sake of it. Be careful, take advice and learn from past errors.\r\n\f\r\nMain Repositories\r\nHer are a list of some of our main repositories, get to know their names and their uses. You may not be proficient in all them, but you should have a decent idea where they fit into the company and what they do, if only to understand what’s happening around you.\r\nAPI - github.com/moltin/api\r\nThe API repository. Our main application, built in mainly in PHP, using the Laravel framework. \r\nForge - github.com/moltin/forge\r\nForge is our whitelisted dashboard. Its important to users as it gives them a graphical user interface to work with our API, add products, manipulate orders etc…\r\nSDK’s\r\nWe use SDK’s as shortcuts to get operability with other languages for our users. “Do you use iOS? Great, we have an SDK for that”. It helps speed up development and delivery. We have SDK’s for iOS, Android, Ruby, PHP, JS, etc… SDK’s are very important.\r\nWebsite - github.com/moltin/website\r\nOur website repository, contains all the files for our front facing site.\r\nFlows - github.com/moltin/flows\r\nFlows is a PHP package for the API that governs how some aspects of the flows system are controlled.\r\n\r\nCart - github.com/moltin/cart\r\nCDN - github.com/moltin/cdn\r\nDevelopment - github.com/moltin/development\r\nThis repo contains all the necessary items to get a local version of our products up and running.\r\nGazlowe - github.com/moltin/gazlowe\r\nGazlowe subscribes to redis and proxies data from a region to Rezlak. Each region has a Gazlowe box running.\r\nRezlak - github.com/moltin/rezlak\r\nRezlak handles webhook and email data sent from gazlowe boxes. He’s built in NodeJS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\f\r\nReading List\r\nThese are a few bits and pieces we advise people to have a read through. There are some basic technical items in here.
