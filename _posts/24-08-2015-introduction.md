Our field guide is a simple non-technical guide to how we operate at Moltin. It doesn’t contain anything about setting up the API on your local machine, how to parse XML in Lisp or anything on geometric theory. Its about the basic principles we all want to work by, and should be read by all new team members.

As Moltin continues to grow we hope that these principles will serve each new person, and that everyone in the team can help build on them and make us an even better company... Even better than we are now.

###Contributing
The field guide is open source, we heavily encourage changes and updates from anyone in the organisation. Fork the main repo and submit your P/R for review.

We would like all new members to contribute something, even if it’s just reading material, but if you don’t feel comfortable, you can just as easily make notes, bring up issues or enhancements in the github repo, we’ll review them and bundle them into a versioned update.
